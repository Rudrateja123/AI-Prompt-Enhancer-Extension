\## About This Project



This is a personal browser extension built to solve a common problem for heavy AI users: the time-consuming process of refining simple ideas into detailed prompts that AI models can understand effectively. Instead of switching between different tools, this extension allows you to enhance your text directly within any text box on any website.



\*\*Key Features:\*\*

\* \*\*Instant Prompt Enhancement:\*\* Select your text and use a keyboard shortcut to instantly transform it.

\* \*\*Seamless Integration:\*\* Works on any website with a text input field (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity, etc.).

\* \*\*User-Friendly Feedback:\*\* A floating "Enhancing..." indicator provides real-time feedback during the API call.

\* \*\*Powered by Gemini:\*\* Uses the Google Gemini API for fast and high-quality text generation.
